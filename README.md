This project employs k-means and Hierarchical clustering, two clustering algorithms to categorize customers from e-commerce data into distinct segments. 
This segmentation is based on purchasing behaviors and the revenue they help the company generate. Complementing this, the daily and weekly demand using XGBoost 
regression model has been predicted which is in terms of the sales of different products.
